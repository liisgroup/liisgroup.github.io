## The LIIS Group

Interaction, in an amazingly wide range of forms, is a fundamental part of our life.  Be it during everyday conversation or within the gates of a logic circuit the way agents and objects interact follows rules and protocols.  
The Logics, Interaction and Intelligent Systems (LIIS) Group investigates the behavior of intelligent systems, from both a theoretical and practical perspective.Our research topics are diverse.  On the one hand we investigate concrete examples of interaction like those that appear in situated natural language understanding and dialogue systems.These themes leads to research in areas like pragmatics of dialogue, natural language generation, machine learning, planning, and knowledge representation and reasoning. On the other hand we investigate fundamental questions in mathematical logic (e.g., complexity, model theory, algebraic logic, inference algorithms, etc.)  that provides the underpinnings for interacting intelligent systems.

LIIS is formed by researchers and students of the Seccion de Ciencias de la Computacion of the Facultad de Matemática, Astronomía y Física, Universidad Nacional de Córdoba en Argentina.
